### Hi there, I'm Andreas! 👋

I am a **Project Lead and AI Strategist** based in Austria. I don't just manage software projects; I accelerate them by integrating cutting-edge AI tools and fostering a culture of empowerment.

🚀 **Current Focus**
*   Leading a **€5M ERP implementation** for wholesale.
*   Pioneering **Vibe Coding** (using *Lovable*) for Rapid Prototyping & UI/UX concepts to drastically reduce time-to-market.
*   Building **High-Performance Scrum Teams** where AI usage is explicitly encouraged.

🧠 **Learning & Exploring**
*   Currently diving deep into **Agentic AI Workflows** (DeepLearning.AI).
*   Experimenting with the intersection of Management Strategy and GenAI tools.

🎯 **My Mission**
I build environments where modern workflows and AI allow teams to iterate at lightning speed. My goal is to establish Austria as a pioneer in AI-driven software delivery.
